<h3> About Me </h3>

		<p> Welcome! My name is Jessica O'Donnell. I am currently a senior at Howard University in Washington D.C. I will be graduating in May of 2019 with a B.A. in Journalism and a minor in Political Science. </p>

		<p>I love living in D.C., but Northern California will always be my home! I grew up in the suburbs of Sacramento, California riding bikes with my friends, attending local art events, and fangirling over the coolest hometown band. </p>

		<p>I have experience in marketing, journalism, and social media. I have passion for the burgeoning world of digital media tactics. So far my motto for my career path has been "go with the flow." On any given day, I have about a million different dream jobs. I hope to find myself in a career that will allow me to engage audiences in unique ways.</p>

<h3> Fast Facts </h3>
<ul>
	<li> I have traveled to over 10 countries.</li>
	<li> My favorite colors are eggplant purple, deep orange, and mustard yellow. </li>
	<li> My favorite TV Show is The X-Files.</li>

</ul>
